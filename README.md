## About

ADAnswersBot is a multipurpose Discord bot developed for and by the Antimatter Dimensions community to provide accurate and reliable answers to game questions. The bot has served tens of thousans of people over the course of the past several years, and with the community's help, it shall be sustained for years to come. This bot was primarily developed by Earth (Jace Royer), a tester and contributor to the game, but many thanks to the following folks for making this possible:

- **Hevipelle** for creating Antimatter Dimensions;
- **Kajfik** for not only developing the Android version of the game, but also providing some helpful code contributions to form the basis of this bot;
- **Ninjatsu** for creating the Eternity Challenge spreadsheet and guide, without which this bot would be effectively useless;
- **MrKrutaman** for art contributions in Glyph Alchemy, Challenge, Glyph, Perk, Time Study, and Upgrade commands;
- **Gaunter** for developing the original version of [GlyphAPI](https://github.com/lrobt97/glyphapi), a few utilities for Glyph calculations;
- **Mirai Sozo** for adding in various odds & ends during the Reality Update Update;
- **So many more**...
- ...and lastly, the **amazing Antimatter Dimensions Discord community** for being a welcoming home for this bot.

### Tech stack

The bot is written in pure TypeScript using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) framework. We use [Bun](https://bun.sh) as our JS runtime and package manager.
