Welcome to ADAnswers-Bot! This bot does *not* collect message content data, but it *does* collect the following:

a) The bot collects the **time** the message was sent;
b) The bot collects **who** sent the message;
c) The bot collects **what** command was used.

All of this data is collected and the top 5 in each category (time, user, and command) are displayed in the bot's `/meta` command. You can opt out of data collection at any time by reaching out to @earth1337_ on Discord.

The bot will also moderate spammers and scammers, and will use message content to detect that.
